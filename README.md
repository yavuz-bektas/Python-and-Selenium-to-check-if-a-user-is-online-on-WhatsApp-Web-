# Python-and-Selenium-to-check-if-a-user-is-online-on-WhatsApp-Web-

This code opens WhatsApp Web in Chrome, waits for the user to log in by scanning the QR code, and then finds the chat window of the user with the specified name or phone number. It checks if the user is online by looking for the presence of a green dot next to their name. Finally, it prints the result and closes the browser.

Note that this code uses ChromeDriver, which is a separate executable that allows Selenium to interact with the Chrome browser. You will need to download and install ChromeDriver and set the correct path to the executable in the code. You can download ChromeDriver from the following link: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
